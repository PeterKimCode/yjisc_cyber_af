                            flow of digital transformation. The Vice Director's office is carefully preparing everything
                            from learning design to support systems so that students' dreams and careers can become
                            reality.</p>
                        <p>We help learners design and achieve their own learning goals through data-based bachelor's,
                            master's, and doctoral management and teaching-learning support systems. In addition, we
                            provide experiences connected to the real field through an industry-academia network
                            connecting the region and the world.</p>
                        <p>GTCC will continue to practice innovation and care as a campus open to everyone. We will
                            always be with you so that your challenge becomes our pride.</p>
